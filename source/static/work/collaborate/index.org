*@@html:<mark>@@I embed remotely with your team for weeks or months to boost velocity hands-on, get projects back on track, and level everyone up along the way.@@html:</mark>@@*

Working from Austria, I'm experienced at collaborating across time zones with teams around the globe.

Here's what you get:

- *Unblocking and accelerating.* We'll ship new features while we simplify complex designs and prepare systems to grow swiftly. Expect a significant drop in the team's time to deliver.


- *Elevating code quality.* I'll help implement established best practices, from the very basics to advanced levels. Expect clean, maintainable code and atomic commits; future-proof, self-documenting APIs; meaningful logs and metrics to power monitoring and alerting; fully automated deployments; and lots more -- it all compounds into lasting gains in quality, velocity and value.


- *Leveling up the team.* Through pairing, thoughtful code reviews, and daily collaboration, junior developers gain confidence and senior developers pick up new techniques. Expect the team to take on more responsibilities in no time.

Regarding tech stack alignment, 15 years of experience with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and related technologies means that I'm most effective in that stack. While I adapt to adjacent tools (like Python and FastAPI, etc.) swiftly, the best collaborations happen when our stacks align -- ensuring I contribute at full capacity from the start.
