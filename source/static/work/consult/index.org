*@@html:<mark>@@I share my experience. Drawing from 20+ years of experience both in fast-growing startups and established enterprises, I provide actionable guidance on typical challenges like taming code complexity, enabling growth, automating operations, etc.@@html:</mark>@@*

Let's just say I've seen a lot so you don't have to :)

Here's what you get:

- *Objective assessment.* I analyze your system from an outside perspective to identify the most promising opportunities for improvement. Expect clear, honest insight and a few refuted assumptions.


- *Practical solutions.* Drawing on two decades of real-world experience, I provide concrete, battle-tested recommendations tailored to your specific situation and constraints. Expect guidance you can implement tomorrow.


- *Confident decisions.* I help you evaluate options and validate your approach before committing significant resources to a major technical decision. Expect reduced risk and the confidence that comes from an experienced perspective.

Engagements are flexible and tailored to your needs -- from a focused half-day session to tackle a specific decision, to ongoing advisory over several weeks for more complex challenges. Common formats include architecture reviews, technical strategy sessions, code audits, and decision workshops.

Sounds good? [[file:../../contact/index.org][Let's talk!]]
