- Know what you want, but have no one to build it?
- Want to validate an idea before investing in it?
- Manual processes preventing you from scaling?

*@@html:<mark>@@I build custom software. Using boring, battle-tested technology and leveraging a trusted network of specialists as needed, I turn your concept into solid and scalable software ready for production.@@html:</mark>@@*

Here's what you get:

- *End-to-end execution.* I handle everything from architecture and implementation to deployment and handoff, so you get a complete, working solution. Expect a seamless process and a system that's ready to use.


- *Deep discovery, simple solutions.* I dig deep until we both fully understand your actual needs, then design the simplest solution that solves the real problem. Expect a system that does exactly what you need without unnecessary complexity or bloat, keeping costs down.


- *Built for the long haul.* Using proven, maintainable technology, I create systems that start simple but can grow with you: easy to operate today and straightforward for any developer to extend tomorrow. Expect low maintenance overhead and a foundation that won't need rebuilding as you scale.

Projects typically range from a few weeks to several months. We'll start with a discovery phase to nail down a minimal set of requirements that makes sense to start with, then move into iterative development with regular check-ins. You'll see working software early and often, not just at the end.

If your project requires a larger team or more comprehensive capabilities, I team up with my friends as [[https://mitfreuden.com][MitFreuden]]: we're four experienced developers who've worked together for years, ready to tackle more demanding projects with full attention and true commitment.

Sounds good? [[file:../../contact/index.org][Let's talk!]]
